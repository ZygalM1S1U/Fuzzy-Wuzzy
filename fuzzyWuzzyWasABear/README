Fuzzy Wuzzy Was a Bear is a basic AI project in C.

The idea of using fuzzy logic for a project so simple seemed like a fun idea.

The project will consist of a conversation with fuzzy, it may turn out he will know a bit more about you than you think.

Once Fuzzy the Von Neumann Bear gets to know you a little better, he may be able to tell if you're lying to him...

I thought this would be a fun project to work on my basic AI skills.
